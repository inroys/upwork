The first script can now do the following:
https://script.google.com/d/1hmsWqpRkaj0hFgAfGMBMLZAsBfPfxbumfQhTO8lxiE4uEqRze-K3Xuy3/edit?usp=sharing


1.Automatically save the attached image of the email sent by Gmail in a specific folder of Google Drive.

2. Get text by OCR from images in a specific folder in Google Drive.

3. Replace specific words in the text with hyperlinks.

4. Automatically send a sentence containing a hyperlink by Gmail.

But when I try to replace the words Google and Go, the short word Go takes precedence and "Google" becomes "Go" ogle. Also, if a sentence contains Go more than once, only the first Go is replaced.


I created a second script to solve this problem, but it timed out.

The test function works fine. However, it will time out if I try to replace the email image.

Modify this second script to not time out, or create a new script that can do the same
